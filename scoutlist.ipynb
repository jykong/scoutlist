    "\n",
    "Scoutlist is a playlist track aggregator for efficient music discovery. Scoutlist helps DJs or other music enthusiants searching for new music that are tired of switching between playlists and skipping songs they've already heard. Scoulist aggregates tracks from a list of user-specified source playlists into a single generated playlist. The generated playlist is free of duplicate tracks and tracks from other user-specified already-listened-to playlists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoutlist is written in Python 3 and uses the Spotify API via the Spotipy library.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using this notebook with multiple users, it's recommended that you make a copy of this for each user."

    "Due to Spotipy's design, this step is fairly hackish.\n",

    "Username is the user ID of the user account who's playlists Scoutlist will access and add to. To find your Spotify username manually, go to profile -> share -> copy URL. All the characters after the last slash (/) are the username.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is the user's first time authenticating or the user's token is expired, authenticate() will open a URL in your web browser requesting authentication permission. Prior to calling authenicate() make sure no other users are logged into Spotify in your web browser. Same goes for Facebook if the user is using a Facebook login.\n",
    "\n",
    "After logging in, you'll be redirected to a localhost URL. It should show a not found error. Don't worry about it. Just copy paste the URL from the web browser into the input field that should appear in the authenticate() output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotipy caches the token in a .cache-{username} file in the script folder so you don't have to reauthenticate every time you run the script. If you want to force a reauthentication, delete the .cache-{username} file.\n",
